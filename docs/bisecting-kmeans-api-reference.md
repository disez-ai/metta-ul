# metta_ul:cluster:bisecting-kmeans

## Overview
This module implements the Bisecting K-means clustering algorithm using iterative splitting of clusters. The algorithm starts with the entire dataset as a single cluster and recursively bisects the cluster with the maximum Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) using standard k-means (with k=2) until a desired number of clusters is reached. The resulting hierarchical clustering structure captures the splits performed during the process.

## Usage
To perform bisecting k-means clustering on a dataset `S` (an `NPArray` of shape `(n, d)`) with a maximum of 5 clusters and 100 maximum iterations for k-means:
```metta
(=
    (clustering-history)
    (bisecting-kmeans.fit (S) 5 100)
)
```
After clustering, you can predict the cluster assignments for S as follows:
```metta
(=
    (cluster-labels)
    (bisecting-kmeans.predict (S) (clustering-history))
)
```

## Notes

- The algorithm repeatedly splits clusters by applying standard k-means with k=2, 
targeting the cluster with the highest SSE for bisection.

- The clustering process maintains a hierarchical structure that records the 
splits performed, which can be used for further analysis or visualization.

- SSE is used as the criterion for selecting the cluster to bisect, 
ensuring that the cluster with the largest dispersion is split at each iteration.
